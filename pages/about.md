**The Contemporary Narratives Lab** is a collaboration between storytellers from across disciplines to explore how old and new ways of producing and communicating stories can bring together diverse communities. It seeks to tell stories based on research and investigation that address contentious social issues. The Lab is a space for artists, journalists, researchers and wider communities to share practice and collaborate on new ways of discovering information, formulating stories and engaging the wider public.
