### Work Tribes
_Paula Varjack / Emma Jacobs and Andrew Hill_

[Work Tribes](https://www.ft.com/work-tribes) is a new series in the Financial Times about the people who populate our modern workplaces, from Millennial managers and Mompreneurs to the professional conference-goer and the long-distance commuter. It's a fictional column, but the characters and workplace dynamics it describes are informed by Emma and Andrew's observations and experience in their career covering business life and management.

Paula brought these characters to life in a series of vignettes. She approached the pieces with the idea of providing "an alien point of view into a foreign world...Finance as something very public but also very exclusive/private/closed off".
